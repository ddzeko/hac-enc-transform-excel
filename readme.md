# HAC ENC Excel Transformer

This repository is for my pet project in Python which takes Excel workbook
produced by HAC (Croatian administrator of tolled paved roads) parses it and
calculates distances and speeds it took to pass from registered entry to
exit point for each record. 

Results are then written into JSON file for easier consumption in apps, e.g.
the one that could show the heatmap of your movement, and into new Excel
workbook for easier viewing since it is human-readable.
